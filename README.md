<h2>Opening the Project</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download this repository, either manually or using git</li>
  <li>Install Unity Editor</li>
  <li>Add the Ted-Singleton-Game folder to Projects</li>
  <li>Install the recommended version of Unity Editor</li>
</ol>

<h2>Setting up the Database</h2>
During development, I have used a Microsoft SQL Server Docker container to manage my database. 
Please create one, using port 1433 for direct compatability with my hardcoded connection string, and create a database called 'GameDB'. 
Then, run the queries found in DBCreation.sql, to create the relevant tables and populate them with some initial data.

<h2>Focus Areas</h2>
<p>When inspecting this project for code I have written, please focus your attention in Ted-Singleton-Game/Assets/Scripts.
This is the folder in which all my own C# scripts have been written. This also includes my unit tests for DatabaseManager.</p>

For some context on other folders in /Assets:
<ul>
  <li>Input contains the PlayerInput asset, and its associated autogenerated C# class. Other scripts subscribe to these events to call functionality</li>
  <li>Materials simply contains the colours I have assigned to various objects in the game</li>
  <li>Prefabs contains files that contain data for my leaderboard row prefab</li>
  <li>Scenes contains each of the scenes I created for the game, including both UI and game levels</li>
  <li>TextMesh Pro contains all the relevant files for TextMesh Pro assets, not written by myself. These assets are used in multiple UI scenes</li>
</ul>
